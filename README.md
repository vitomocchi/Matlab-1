Summary
Exercise 1: 2D Random Walks on a Lattice

Objective:
The first exercise aimed to compute and analyze two-dimensional random walks on a lattice using Matlab.

Methodology:

Defined what a random walk is and its properties.
Implemented a Matlab script (runRW2D.m) that uses a function (randomwalk2D.m) to generate a 2D random walk with N steps.
The function takes two arguments: N (number of steps) and toplot (whether to plot the walk or not).
Used mathematical modeling to verify the symmetry of the generated random walk.
Calculated the variance of the final position for different values of N.
Results:

The experimental results confirmed the theoretical predictions about the average distance traveled in 2D.
